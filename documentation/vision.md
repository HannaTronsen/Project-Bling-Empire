This project is inspired firstly by my first stock assistant tool I made in 2020 and that is described on my personal website: https://hannatronsen.herokuapp.com/projects
but then later also by the netflix tv show named Bling Empire. My stock analysis tool was developed in an attempt to make picking stocks easier and less risk prone, but considering my lack
of coding experience back then, only a fool (like me) would actually trust the assistant;  Though I have to say that my stock assistant picked Kitron to be Oslo BÃ¸rs number one stock pick,
and I have monitored Kitron's stock price shoot up to the moon while silently watching from the side line after taking profit too early in the run-up...

I bought around 17-18 NOK and now I just cry in my sleep ðŸ˜­

## Reason for working on this project

- Fun to have a hobby project
- 99% of newly founded companies statistically go bankrupt within 5-10 years
- I read somewhere that investing could be compared with runing a business, but the overhead and amount of work required to run a succesful business is way more demanding
- Passive income for the win, get better at making money in your sleep instead of having sleepless nights worrying about business matters
- I thought I wanted to build a business, to prove myself and to add to the small number of feemale leeders in the top possitions, but why do all the work and risk neglecting the important things in life

- Plan B is to use this project as a launchingpad for aquiring a 9-5 job and to show at least what I can do with code


## MVP - Stock Assistant V2 
- Periodically add more tickers [on-going]
- [ ] Reformat code to fit ES6 standard
- [ ] Pick a suitable API for fetching stock ticker data
- [ ] Write test to confirm that API working and to detect when used endpoint response signatures have changed
- [ ] Figure out what data I want to save and what stock indicators to emphasize when determening the value of a stock
- [ ] Crunch the data and write tests for the values being given by the formulas I write
- [ ] Export the data in a CSV file with possibility to sort the rows by column

## Future vision

Make the CSV data into an interactive report that will only give you the most important information and the most interesting companies
