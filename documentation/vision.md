This project is inspired firstly by my first stock assistant tool I made in 2020 and that is described on my [personal website](https://hannatronsen.herokuapp.com/projects)
but then later also by the netflix tv show named Bling Empire. My stock analysis tool was developed in an attempt to make picking stocks easier and less risk prone, but considering my lack
of coding experience back then, only a fool (like me) would actually trust the assistant;  Though I have to say that my stock assistant picked Kitron to be Oslo BÃ¸rs number one stock pick,
and I have monitored Kitron's stock price shoot up to the moon while silently watching from the side line after taking profit too early in the run-up...

I bought around 17-18 NOK and now I just cry in my sleep ðŸ˜­

## Reason for working on this project

- Fun to have a hobby project
- 99% of newly founded companies statistically go bankrupt within 5-10 years
- I read somewhere that investing could be compared with runing a business, but the overhead and amount of work required to run a succesful business is way more demanding
- Passive income for the win, get better at making money in your sleep instead of having sleepless nights worrying about business matters
- I thought I wanted to build a business, to prove myself and to add to the small number of feemale leeders in the top possitions, but why do all the work and risk neglecting the important things in life

- Plan B is to use this project as a launchingpad for aquiring a 9-5 job and to show at least what I can do with code

## MVP - Stock Assistant V2 
The primary goal of this project is to assess stocks from various stock exchanges and assign them ratings. Initially, the results will be exported into a sortable CSV file, where the top-performing companies will be listed at the beginning. This iteration will resemble Version 1 of the stock assistant mentioned on my [hobby page](https://hannatronsen.herokuapp.com/projects), but with improved and more reliable code. By adhering to corporate coding standards and employing thorough testing methodologies, we can place greater confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the results compared to Version 1. Moreover, the updated version features more enhanced error handling capabilities and also provide better scalability options for future expansion.

## Future vision
- Make the CSV data into an interactive report that will only give you the most important information and the most interesting companies. It should give a run down of why the company passed the stock evaluation check and back the findings with real investing theories and best practices applied in order to deem the stock as a safe investment in the long run. 

-  Make the report more tailored to each specific user.

- Provide a macro economic overview to inform the investor about possible economic dampeners.

- Make a suggestive budget and finance managing tool (possibly powered by some AI?)
